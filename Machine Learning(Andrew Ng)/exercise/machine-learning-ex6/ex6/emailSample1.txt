His Word Does Not Return Void:
A Conversation with Rev. Dr. Bernice A. King

In this YouVersion exclusive video, Rev. Dr. Bernice A. King shares how the power of God’s Word shaped her life growing up as the daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., and how we can tap into that same power today, in order to practice true justice towards others: by walking in mercy and humility.

When you start practicing in this vein — doing justice, and loving mercy — it invites God into the equation and gives Him room to operate.
